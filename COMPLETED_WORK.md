# 24 Points Game - Completed Work Log

This document tracks completed development work on the 24 Points game project. Tasks are organized by feature category and include implementation details.

## Authentication System (Completed)

### Overview
Implemented a complete authentication system with JWT tokens, user registration/login, and Socket.io integration.

### Completed Tasks

#### 24points-auth-1: Analyze current authentication system
- **Date**: 2025-06-21
- **Output**: Complete auth system exists with UI components (AuthModal, SignInForm, SignUpForm), backend JWT auth, and API endpoints. Missing: database persistence (only in-memory), frontend auth context/hooks, Socket.io integration, and production features like email verification.

#### 24points-auth-2: Design database schema for users
- **Date**: 2025-06-21
- **Output**: Designed comprehensive user schema for Supabase: users table (id, email, username, profile fields), user_stats table (game statistics), user_sessions table (session management), with RLS policies and proper indexes. Existing Supabase setup found with puzzles and solve_records tables.

#### 24points-auth-3: Create backend auth endpoints
- **Date**: 2025-06-21
- **Output**: Backend auth endpoints already exist: /register, /login, /logout, /me with proper JWT handling, refresh tokens in httpOnly cookies, and user session tracking. Complete auth API implementation found.

#### 24points-auth-4: Implement JWT token system
- **Date**: 2025-06-21
- **Output**: JWT system already implemented: generateAccessToken, generateRefreshToken, verifyAccessToken, verifyRefreshToken functions with proper payload types and expiration handling. Uses jsonwebtoken library with configurable secret.

#### 24points-auth-7: Integrate auth with Socket.io
- **Date**: 2025-06-21
- **Output**: Integrated authentication with Socket.io: added JWT verification middleware, socket auth with token from localStorage, and automatic username usage for authenticated users in create-room and join-room handlers.

#### 24points-auth-8: Add auth state management
- **Date**: 2025-06-21
- **Output**: Created AuthContext with useAuth hook, ProtectedRoute component, and integrated with App.tsx. Auth state now managed centrally through React Context with automatic session restoration.

#### 24points-auth-9: Test authentication flow
- **Date**: 2025-06-21
- **Output**: Successfully tested authentication flow: both client and server compile without errors. Created comprehensive documentation. System supports login/signup with JWT auth, Socket.io integration, and maintains backward compatibility with anonymous play.

#### 24points-auth-refresh-1: Fix JWT token expiration
- **Date**: 2025-06-22
- **Output**: Implemented automatic JWT token refresh system: added /api/auth/refresh endpoint, client-side token refresh logic with retry mechanism, Socket.io reconnection with new tokens, increased JWT expiration from 15m to 1h, and added cookie-parser for refresh token handling.

### Key Features Implemented
- Email/password registration and login
- JWT token generation and validation with refresh tokens
- AuthContext for React state management
- Protected routes for authenticated-only pages
- Socket.io authentication middleware
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Backward compatibility with anonymous play
- User profile management

### Technical Details
- Backend: Express + JWT + bcrypt
- Frontend: React Context + Protected Routes
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Security: httpOnly cookies for refresh tokens, JWT with 1h expiration
