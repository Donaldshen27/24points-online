# Answer Screen Implementation (Task 3.2)

## Overview
The answer screen provides an interactive interface for players to build their 24-point solutions step by step. When a player claims "I know it!", they are presented with the SolutionBuilder component where they can select cards and operations to create their solution.

## Components

### GameScreen Component
The main game component that orchestrates the entire game flow.

**Features:**
- Displays game state (waiting, playing, solving, round end, game over)
- Shows both players' hands with card counts
- Center table with 4 shared cards
- Round timer (2 minutes) and solution timer (30 seconds)
- "I know it!" button for claiming solutions
- Solution result messages
- Game over modal with winner/loser display

**Key Functions:**
- `handleSubmitSolution`: Submits the solution to the server
- `handleCancelSolution`: Cancels solution building
- Socket event listeners for round results and errors

### SolutionBuilder Component (Pre-existing)
Interactive interface for building 24-point solutions.

**Features:**
- Step-by-step solution construction
- Card and operation selection
- Real-time calculation display
- Undo/reset functionality
- Solution validation
- Submit and cancel buttons

### Integration Points

1. **Socket Events:**
   - `claim-solution`: Player claims they have a solution
   - `submit-solution`: Submits the built solution
   - `round-ended`: Receives round results
   - `claim-error`: Error when claiming fails
   - `submit-error`: Error when submission fails

2. **Game State Management:**
   - Uses `useGameState` hook for real-time state updates
   - Tracks solving state and timers
   - Handles state transitions automatically

3. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Success/failure messages after solution attempts
   - Timer displays with urgent state (red when < 10 seconds)
   - Animated transitions between states

## Game Flow

1. **Playing State:**
   - 4 cards displayed on center table
   - Players can click "I know it!" when ready
   - 2-minute round timer counting down

2. **Solving State:**
   - Solution builder modal appears for claiming player
   - 30-second timer for solution submission
   - Other player sees "Opponent is solving..." message

3. **Round End:**
   - Result message shows who won/lost
   - Cards automatically transferred based on result
   - New round starts after 3 seconds

4. **Game Over:**
   - Modal displays final winner
   - Shows final card counts
   - "Play Again" button to reset

## Error Handling

- Network disconnection handling
- Invalid solution attempts
- Timer expiration
- Concurrent claim attempts

## Testing

To test the answer screen:
1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Open two browser windows at http://localhost:5173
3. Create/join same room with both players
4. Start the game and test:
   - Claiming solutions
   - Building valid/invalid solutions
   - Timer expiration
   - Round transitions
   - Game completion

## Future Enhancements

- Animation for card transfers
- Sound effects for actions
- Solution history display
- Hint system integration
- Replay functionality
