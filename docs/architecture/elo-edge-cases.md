# ELO Rating System Edge Cases

This document describes how the 24 Points ELO rating system handles edge cases and extreme scenarios.

## Rating Bounds

### Rating Floor (400)
- **Behavior**: Players cannot drop below 400 rating, even with consecutive losses
- **Implementation**: All rating calculations apply a minimum constraint of 400
- **Purpose**: Prevents negative or extremely low ratings that could break matchmaking

### Rating Ceiling (3000)
- **Behavior**: Players cannot exceed 3000 rating, though this is a soft cap
- **Implementation**: All rating calculations apply a maximum constraint of 3000
- **Purpose**: Prevents rating inflation and maintains system integrity

## Extreme Rating Differences

### High-Rated Player Wins Against Low-Rated Player
- **Scenario**: 2800 rating vs 400 rating, high-rated wins
- **Behavior**: Winner gains minimal points (0-1), loser loses minimal points
- **Reason**: Expected outcome provides little information about skill

### Major Upset (Low-Rated Beats High-Rated)
- **Scenario**: 600 rating vs 2600 rating, low-rated wins
- **Behavior**: Winner gains maximum possible points (~30), loser loses significant points (~15)
- **Reason**: Unexpected outcome provides strong signal about skill levels

## Invalid Input Handling

### Negative Games Played
- **Input**: Games played count < 0
- **Behavior**: Treated as 0 games (placement matches)
- **K-Factor**: Uses highest K-factor (40) for maximum rating mobility

### Out-of-Bounds Initial Ratings
- **Input**: Rating > 3000 or < 400
- **Behavior**: Clamped to valid range before calculation
- **Purpose**: Ensures system stability even with corrupted data

## Placement Match Edge Cases

### Perfect Placement Record
- **Scenario**: 10-0 in placement matches
- **Result**: ~1700 rating (500 above base)
- **Reasoning**: Strong performance but limited sample size

### Winless Placement
- **Scenario**: 0-10 in placement matches
- **Result**: ~700 rating (500 below base)
- **Reasoning**: Poor performance but maintains ability to recover

## K-Factor Boundaries

### Transition Points
- **0-9 games**: K=40 (Placement)
- **10-29 games**: K=30 (New Player)
- **30-99 games**: K=20 (Regular)
- **100+ games**: K=15 (Experienced)
- **Behavior**: Smooth transitions prevent rating volatility jumps

## Protection Mechanisms

### Rank Protection
- **When**: First game after promotion to new tier
- **Effect**: Cannot be demoted on immediate loss
- **Example**: Promoted to Silver (1400), lose next game
  - Without protection: Could drop to 1395 (Bronze)
  - With protection: Stay at 1400 (Silver floor)

### Inactivity Decay
- **Threshold**: 28 days without playing
- **Decay Rate**: -25 rating per 28-day period
- **Floor**: Cannot decay below 400 rating
- **Purpose**: Maintain accurate skill distribution

## Mathematical Edge Cases

### Equal Ratings
- **Scenario**: Both players have identical ratings
- **Win Probability**: Exactly 50%
- **Rating Change**: Winner gains exactly K/2, loser loses K/2

### Maximum Rating Difference
- **Scenario**: 3000 vs 400 rating
- **Win Probability**: ~99.99% for higher rated
- **Rating Change**: Near zero for expected outcome

## System Stability Guarantees

1. **Conservation**: Total rating points in system remain relatively stable
2. **Convergence**: Players converge to true skill level over time
3. **Bounds**: All ratings remain within [400, 3000] range
4. **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
5. **Reversible**: Can reconstruct rating history from match results

## Testing Coverage
