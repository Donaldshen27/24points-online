# Authentication Test Page Implementation

## Overview
Created a comprehensive authentication test page accessible through Test Mode to debug and verify authentication functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication Test Component (`/client/src/components/AuthTest/`)
- Real-time auth state display showing current user info
- Test credentials input fields
- Multiple test actions:
  - Test Registration
  - Test Login
  - Test Direct Auth Service calls
  - Test Logout
  - Check Auth State
  - Check Backend Connection
- Live test results display with timestamps
- Clear visual feedback for success/failure

### 2. Fixed Sign-In/Sign-Up Forms
- Updated both forms to use `useAuth` hook from AuthContext instead of calling authService directly
- This ensures the auth state is properly synchronized across the app
- Forms now properly update the global auth state on successful login/registration

### 3. UI Improvements
- Navigation component already displays authenticated user info when logged in
- Shows username avatar, rating, and games count
- Dropdown menu with Profile, Settings, Statistics, and Sign Out options

## How to Use

1. Click the "Test Mode" button in the navigation bar
2. Select "Authentication Test" from the test menu
3. Use the test page to:
   - Register a new account
   - Login with existing credentials
   - Check current auth state
   - Test backend connectivity
   - View detailed logs of all operations

## Key Changes Made

1. **AuthTest Component**: New comprehensive testing interface for authentication
2. **SignInForm.tsx**: Now uses `useAuth` hook instead of direct authService calls
3. **SignUpForm.tsx**: Now uses `useAuth` hook for proper state management
4. **App.tsx**: Added AuthTest to test mode options

## Authentication Flow

1. User fills in credentials in SignIn/SignUp form
2. Form calls the appropriate method from `useAuth` hook
3. AuthContext handles the authentication with authService
4. On success, AuthContext updates the global user state
5. Navigation component automatically reflects the logged-in state
6. User info is displayed with avatar and dropdown menu

## Testing Authentication

The test page provides several ways to verify auth is working:
- Visual confirmation of current auth state
- Direct testing of login/register functions
- Backend connectivity verification
- LocalStorage inspection
- Access token validation

This comprehensive test page makes it easy to debug any authentication issues and verify that the auth system is working correctly end-to-end.
