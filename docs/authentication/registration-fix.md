# Registration Error Fix

## Issue
The registration endpoint was returning "All fields are required" error because the frontend was not sending the `confirmPassword` field that the backend expected.

## Root Cause
- Backend `authService.register()` expected 4 fields: `email`, `username`, `password`, and `confirmPassword`
- Frontend was only sending 3 fields: `email`, `username`, and `password`

## Solution
Updated the frontend to include `confirmPassword` in the registration request:

1. **Updated `authService.ts`**: Added `confirmPassword` to the `RegisterRequest` interface
2. **Updated `SignUpForm.tsx`**: Modified the register call to include `confirmPassword` from form data
3. **Updated `AuthContext.tsx`**: Updated the register function signature to accept `confirmPassword`
4. **Fixed `App.tsx`**: Changed `mode` prop to `defaultTab` for AuthModal component

## Changes Made
- `/client/src/services/authService.ts`: Added confirmPassword to RegisterRequest interface
- `/client/src/components/SignUpForm/SignUpForm.tsx`: Included confirmPassword in register call
- `/client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`: Updated register function signature
- `/client/src/App.tsx`: Fixed AuthModal prop name from mode to defaultTab

## Testing
Both client and server build successfully without TypeScript errors. The registration flow should now work correctly with all required fields being sent to the backend.
