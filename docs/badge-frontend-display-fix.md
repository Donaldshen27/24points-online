# Badge Frontend Display Fix

## Problem
Badges are saved in the database but not showing in the frontend badges tab.

## Root Cause
Data structure mismatch between what the database returns and what the frontend expects:
- Database columns use snake_case: `user_id`, `badge_id`, `is_featured`
- Frontend expects camelCase: `userId`, `badgeId`, `isFeatured`

## Solution
Added data transformation in the server route to convert the database response to match frontend expectations:

```typescript
// Transform badges to match frontend expectations
const transformedBadges = (badges || []).map(b => ({
  id: b.id,
  userId: b.user_id,
  badgeId: b.badge_id,
  earnedAt: b.earned_at || new Date().toISOString(),
  progress: b.progress || {},
  isFeatured: b.is_featured || false,
  badge: b.badge // Keep the joined badge definition
}));
```

## Additional Debugging
Added logging to help debug:
1. Server: Logs badge count and structure when fetched
2. Frontend: Logs the full response in BadgeGallery

## What to Check
In the browser console, you should see:
```
[BadgeService] Badge response: { badges: [...], statistics: {...} }
[BadgeGallery] Fetched badges: { badges: [...], statistics: {...} }
```

The badges array should contain objects with:
- `badgeId` (e.g., "speed_demon_bronze")
- `userId` (your user ID)
- `earnedAt` (timestamp)
- `badge` (the full badge definition with name, description, etc.)

## Common Issues
1. **No badges showing**: Check if the API call is authenticated (needs access token)
2. **Empty response**: Verify the user ID matches between auth and badges
3. **UI not updating**: The badge definitions might not match between client and server
