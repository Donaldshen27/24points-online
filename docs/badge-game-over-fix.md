# Badge System Game Over Fix

## Problem
Player JD didn't receive badges despite:
- Winning games
- Solving puzzles in under 10 seconds (fastest: 6.7 seconds)
- Having proper statistics recorded

## Root Cause
Badge checking was NOT happening at game end. The badge detection code was in the wrong place:
- It was inside the `submit-solution` handler waiting for `game_over` state
- But game actually ends in `RoomManager` when starting a new round with insufficient cards
- The two code paths never connected

## Solution
Added badge checking to `RoomManager` where game-over is actually emitted:

```typescript
// In RoomManager.ts after emitting game-over
this.checkBadgesAfterGame(room, gameState, gameOverResult);
```

## What Should Happen Now

When a game ends, you'll see:
```
[RoomManager] Checking badges after game for room: XXXXX
[RoomManager] Checking badges for player JD (user-id)
[BadgeDetection] Checking badges for user user-id
[BadgeDetection] User stats: { ... }
[BadgeDetection] Attempting to award badge speed_demon_bronze to user ...
[BadgeDetection] Badge awarded successfully: ...
[RoomManager] Player JD unlocked 2 badges!
```

## Badges JD Should Get

Based on the stats shown:
- **speed_demon_bronze**: Solve under 10 seconds ✅ (fastest: 6.7s)
- **speed_demon_silver**: Solve under 7 seconds ✅ (fastest: 6.7s)
- **champion_bronze**: Win 10 games (needs 3 wins, has 3) ❌
- **unstoppable_bronze**: Win 3 in a row ✅ (current streak: 3)
- **veteran_bronze**: Play 10 games (needs 10, has 3) ❌

## Speed Badge Thresholds
- Bronze: Under 10 seconds (10000ms)
- Silver: Under 7 seconds (7000ms)
- Gold: Under 5 seconds (5000ms)
- Platinum: Under 4 seconds (4000ms)
- Diamond: Under 3 seconds (3000ms)
