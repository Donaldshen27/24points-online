# Badge System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Speed Demon Badge Comparison Operator
**Problem**: Used `gte` (greater than or equal) instead of `lte` (less than or equal)
**Impact**: Made Speed Demon badges impossible to earn - players would need to be SLOWER than the threshold
**Fix**: Added conditional logic to use `lte` for `fastestSolveMs` comparisons

### 2. Accuracy Master Badge Requirements
**Problem**: Referenced non-existent `accuracyRate` field in user statistics
**Impact**: Badge detection would fail with undefined field access
**Fix**: Created custom accuracy badge function that uses compound requirements:
- Custom `accuracy_rate` requirement that calculates accuracy on the fly
- Simple requirement for minimum 50 attempts using `totalCorrectSolutions`

### 3. Database Field Name Mismatches
**Problem**: Code used `featured` but database schema defines `is_featured`
**Impact**: Featured badge updates would fail
**Fix**: Updated field names to match database schema

### 4. Launch Week Date Placeholder
**Problem**: Hardcoded placeholder date (2024-01-01)
**Fix**: Updated to 2025-01-01 with TODO comment for actual launch date

## Remaining Issues to Address

### 1. Unimplemented Custom Requirements
Several badge types still return `false` and need implementation:
- `same_opponent_games` - Track games with same opponent
- `sub_second_solves` - Count sub-1000ms solves
- `marathon_session` - Track 3+ hour sessions
- `all_operations_used` - Track using all 4 operations
- `minimal_operations_win` - Win with only +/- operations
- `multiple_languages` - Track language usage

### 2. Missing Database Functions
- `get_min_solve_time_for_puzzle` RPC function for puzzle records

### 3. Type Safety
- Remove `as any` casts and add proper type definitions
- Create proper stat key type that matches UserStatistics interface

### 4. SQL Migration Sync
- Ensure all TypeScript badge definitions match the SQL seed data exactly
- Fix `totalAttempts` reference (should be calculated value)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Add tests for badge requirement evaluation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test badge unlocking flow end-to-end
3. **Data Validation**: Ensure stats are tracked correctly
4. **Edge Cases**: Test tier progression, multiple badge unlocks

## Code Quality Improvements

1. Add TypeScript strict mode to catch type issues
2. Create badge validation utility to verify definitions
3. Add logging for badge check failures
4. Implement badge analytics tracking
