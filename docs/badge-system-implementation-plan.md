```

### API Integration
```typescript
// Socket events to implement
socket.on('badges-unlocked', (badges) => {});
socket.emit('get-user-badges', { userId }, (response) => {});
socket.emit('get-user-statistics', { userId }, (response) => {});
socket.emit('track-special-badge-event', { userId, eventType, eventData });
```

### State Management
- Add badge slice to Redux/Context
- Cache badge data locally
- Update on unlock events
- Sync with server periodically

## Testing Plan

### Backend Testing
1. Unit tests for badge requirement evaluation
2. Integration tests for statistics tracking
3. Badge award flow testing
4. Performance testing with many badges

### Frontend Testing
1. Component rendering tests
2. Badge unlock animation tests
3. Progress tracking accuracy
4. Multi-language support tests

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Database Migration**
   - Run migrations in order (002, 003, 004)
   - Seed badge definitions
   - Initialize existing user statistics

2. **Performance**
   - Index optimization for badge queries
   - Caching strategy for badge data
   - Lazy loading for badge images

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track badge unlock rates
   - Monitor popular badges
   - Analyze user engagement metrics

## Future Enhancements

1. **Badge Trading System**
   - Exchange duplicate badges
   - Badge marketplace
   - Rarity-based trading values

2. **Seasonal Events**
   - Monthly badge rotations
   - Holiday-specific badges
   - Limited-time challenges

3. **Social Features**
   - Badge sharing to social media
   - Badge achievement feed
   - Friend badge comparisons

4. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Badge completion rates
   - User retention by badge count
   - A/B testing badge requirements

## Success Metrics

1. **Engagement**
   - Daily active users increase
   - Session length improvement
   - Return player rate

2. **Progression**
   - Average badges per user
   - Badge unlock rate
   - Level distribution

3. **Retention**
   - 7-day retention improvement
   - 30-day retention improvement
   - Long-term player loyalty

## Timeline Estimate

- Frontend Badge Gallery: 2-3 days
- Profile Integration: 1-2 days
- Notification System: 1-2 days
- Leaderboard Updates: 1 day
- Testing & Polish: 2-3 days
- **Total: 7-11 days**

## Notes

- All backend infrastructure is complete and tested
- Frontend implementation can begin immediately
- Consider phased rollout with feature flags
- Monitor server load during initial launch
