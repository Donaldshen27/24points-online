# Complete Badge i18n Fix

## Issue
Badge components were displaying translation keys instead of actual translated text in both English and Chinese versions. This affected:
- Badge gallery title
- Category names
- Points labels
- Filter placeholders
- All other badge-related text

## Root Cause
The issue was with React-i18next's Suspense mode. When `useSuspense: true` was set, the components were rendering before translations were fully loaded, despite having a Suspense boundary.

## Solution

### 1. Disabled Suspense Mode
In `i18n/config.ts`:
```typescript
react: {
  useSuspense: false  // Changed from true
}
```

### 2. Removed Suspense Wrapper
Since Suspense is no longer needed with `useSuspense: false`, removed it from `main.tsx`:
```typescript
// Before:
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <AuthProvider>
    <App />
  </AuthProvider>
</Suspense>

// After:
<AuthProvider>
  <App />
</AuthProvider>
```

### 3. Fixed TypeScript Errors
Updated default cases in switch statements to return 'Unknown' instead of trying to manipulate the enum value, which TypeScript knew was impossible.

## How This Works

With `useSuspense: false`:
1. Components render immediately
2. `useTranslation()` hook returns translations synchronously if available
3. If translations aren't loaded yet, it returns the translation key
4. Once translations load, components automatically re-render with correct text
5. Both English and Chinese translations work properly

## Benefits
- No more translation keys showing in UI
- Works for all languages (English, Chinese, etc.)
- No need for English-only fallbacks
- Simpler setup without Suspense complexity

## Result
All badge page text now displays correctly:
- "Badge Collection" instead of "badges.gallery.title"
- "All", "Skill", "Progression" etc. instead of "badges.categories.*"
- "Points" instead of "badges.points"
- Proper placeholders and labels throughout

The fix ensures that the i18n system works reliably across all badge components without showing raw translation keys to users.
