# Badge Page i18n Translation Fix

## Issue
The badges page was displaying translation keys (e.g., "badges.categories.all", "badges.points") instead of the actual translated text.

## Root Cause
The issue was that React-i18next requires a Suspense boundary when using the `useTranslation` hook, but the app didn't have one wrapping the root component.

## Solution

### 1. Added Suspense Boundary
Updated `main.tsx` to wrap the entire app in a Suspense component:
```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <AuthProvider>
      <App />
    </AuthProvider>
  </Suspense>
)
```

### 2. Configured i18n for React
Added React configuration to `i18n/config.ts`:
```tsx
react: {
  useSuspense: true
}
```

### 3. Verified Translations Exist
Confirmed all required translations are present in `en.json`:
- `badges.gallery.title` → "Badge Collection"
- `badges.categories.all` → "All"
- `badges.categories.skill` → "Skill"
- `badges.points` → "Points"
- etc.

## How React-i18next Works

1. **Initialization**: i18n is initialized with translation resources
2. **Suspense**: React Suspense ensures translations are loaded before rendering
3. **useTranslation Hook**: Components use `const { t } = useTranslation()` to get the translation function
4. **Translation**: `t('badges.categories.all')` returns "All" from the loaded translations

## Testing
After these changes:
- Translation keys are properly replaced with their values
- The page shows "Badge Collection" instead of "badges.gallery.title"
- Category names show properly (All, Skill, Progression, etc.)
- Points display as "Points" instead of "badges.points"

## Additional Notes
- The duplicate "points" entry in different sections of en.json doesn't cause issues as they're in different namespaces
- The Suspense boundary also improves the loading experience by showing a loading state while translations load
