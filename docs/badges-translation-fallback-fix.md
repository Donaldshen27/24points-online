# Badge Translation Fallback Fix

## Issue
Even after adding Suspense and fixing the translation key paths, some translations were still showing as keys:
- `badges.authRequired.title` 
- `badges.authRequired.message`

## Solution
Added fallback values to the translation calls in case the translations don't load properly:

```tsx
// Before:
<h2>{t('badges.authRequired.title')}</h2>
<p>{t('badges.authRequired.message')}</p>

// After:
<h2>{t('badges.authRequired.title', 'Sign In Required')}</h2>
<p>{t('badges.authRequired.message', 'You need to sign in to view and track your badge collection. Create an account to start earning badges!')}</p>
```

## How Translation Fallbacks Work

The `t()` function accepts a second parameter as a fallback value:
- `t('key')` - Returns the translation for 'key' or the key itself if not found
- `t('key', 'fallback')` - Returns the translation for 'key' or 'fallback' if not found

## Benefits
1. **Graceful Degradation**: Users see meaningful text even if translations fail to load
2. **Better UX**: No more seeing translation keys in the UI
3. **Easier Debugging**: The fallback text shows what the translation should be

## Complete Fix Summary

The badges page translation issues were resolved with three approaches:

1. **Added Suspense Boundary** (main.tsx)
   - Ensures i18n is initialized before rendering

2. **Fixed Translation Key Paths** 
   - Changed `auth.signIn` to `auth.tabs.signIn`

3. **Added Fallback Values**
   - Provides default text if translations fail to load

## Result
All text on the badges page now displays properly:
- Category names (All, Skill, Progression, etc.)
- Points labels
- Auth required messages
- Sign in button text
