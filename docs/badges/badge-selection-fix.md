# Badge Selection Fix

## Issue
The personal profile featured badges feature was not allowing users to select badges or add badges to their showcase.

## Root Cause
The server-side `getUserBadges` method was not returning the `featured` field (stored as `is_featured` in database) or the `icon` field from badge definitions.

## Solution

### 1. Updated BadgeDetectionService.ts
- Added `featured: userBadge.is_featured || false` to the enriched badge data
- Added `icon: badge.icon || 'üèÜ'` to include the badge icon with fallback

### 2. Updated BadgeShowcase Component
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Fixed badge ID references to handle both `badgeId` and `badge_id` formats
- Added error handling and user feedback for failed operations

### 3. Updated Type Definitions
- Added optional `icon?: string` field to BadgeDefinition interface
- Added `badge_id?: string` to EnrichedUserBadge interface for server compatibility

### 4. CSS Improvements
- Added `pointer-events: auto` to ensure badge selection clicks work
- Added `z-index: 1001` to modal content for proper layering

## Testing Instructions
1. Log in to your account
2. Navigate to your profile page
3. Click the "Edit" button in the Featured Badges section
4. Select up to 5 badges from your earned badges
5. Click "Save" to update your featured badges

## Debug Logging
The following console logs have been added for troubleshooting:
