# Accuracy System Removal

## Why Removed
The accuracy tracking system was removed because it no longer makes sense with the current game mechanics:

1. **Automatic submission**: Solutions are automatically submitted when players reach exactly 24 with one card remaining
2. **No manual submission**: Players can't choose when to submit, eliminating the risk of incorrect attempts
3. **System validates**: The game automatically detects when 24 is reached, making "incorrect attempts" nearly impossible

## What Was Removed

### 1. Badges
- **Accuracy Master badges** (Bronze through Diamond) - Required maintaining 70-99% accuracy
- **Perfect Game badge** - Win without incorrect attempts

### 2. Statistics Tracking
- `incorrectAttempts` field from GameRoom interface
- `totalIncorrectAttempts` from user statistics
- Incorrect attempt tracking in GameStateManager
- `perfectGame` calculation logic

### 3. Badge Detection Logic
- `accuracy_rate` custom requirement case in BadgeDetectionService
- Related accuracy calculations

### 4. Game Logic
- Tracking of incorrect solution attempts
- Perfect game detection based on zero incorrect attempts

## Impact
- Simplifies the statistics system
- Removes misleading metrics that don't reflect actual gameplay
- Focuses badges on meaningful achievements like speed, consistency, and milestones

## Remaining Skill-Based Badges
- **Speed Demon**: Solve puzzles quickly (under X seconds)
- **Lightning Reflexes**: Be first to solve in many rounds
- **Flawless Victory**: Win 10-0 (opponent gets all 20 cards)

These badges better reflect actual player skill in the current game system.
