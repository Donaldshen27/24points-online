# Animation Completion Fix

## Problem
The solution replay animations were being cut off or skipped before they could finish playing, resulting in a poor user experience where the final "= 24! Brilliant!" animation would not be seen.

## Root Causes
1. **State Transitions**: The game state would transition from REPLAY to PLAYING too quickly, causing the replay component to unmount
2. **Component Lifecycle**: The onComplete callback was firing immediately when the animation steps finished, not waiting for the actual animations to render
3. **Server Timing**: The server's replay timeout (7 seconds) was sometimes too short for all animations to complete

## Solution

### 1. Animation Completion Tracking
Added explicit animation completion tracking in `SolutionReplay.tsx`:
- Added `animationComplete` state to track when animations are truly done
- Added `animationTimeoutRef` to manage cleanup properly
- Modified the completion logic to wait 1.5 seconds after the last step for final animations
- Skip functionality now also respects animation timing with a 500ms delay

### 2. Replay State Management
Enhanced replay lifecycle management in `GameScreen.tsx`:
- Added `replayCompleting` state to prevent premature unmounting
- Added 300ms delay after onComplete before hiding the replay
- Modified state change detection to respect ongoing animations
- Prevented round result modal from showing during replay

### 3. Server Timing Adjustment
Increased server replay timeout from 7 to 15 seconds in `GameStateManager.ts` to ensure sufficient time for all animations to complete fully.

### 4. CSS Enhancements
Added CSS properties to protect animations:
- `will-change: opacity` for performance optimization
- `pointer-events: all` to ensure overlay remains interactive

## Key Changes

### SolutionReplay.tsx
```typescript
// Added animation completion tracking
const [animationComplete, setAnimationComplete] = useState(false);
const animationTimeoutRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);

// Modified completion logic
if (currentStep >= steps.length && !animationComplete) {
  setAnimationComplete(true);
  animationTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
    if (onComplete) onComplete();
  }, 1500); // Give time for final animation
}
```

### GameScreen.tsx
```typescript
// Added replay completing state
const [replayCompleting, setReplayCompleting] = useState(false);

// Enhanced onComplete handler
onComplete={() => {
  setReplayCompleting(true);
  setTimeout(() => {
    setShowingSolutionReplay(false);
    setReplaySolution(null);
    setReplayCompleting(false);
  }, 300);
}}
```

## Result
Animations now complete fully before transitioning, ensuring users see the complete replay including the satisfying "= 24! Brilliant!" finale.
