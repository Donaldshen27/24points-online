# User Dropdown Menu Fix

## Issue
The user dropdown menu was disappearing when users tried to move their cursor from the trigger button to the menu items. This was caused by a gap between the trigger and dropdown, causing the hover state to be lost.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. CSS Improvements
- **Added invisible bridge**: Created a pseudo-element (::before) on `.nav-user` to bridge the gap between trigger and dropdown
- **Improved transitions**: Added visibility transition with delay to prevent instant disappearing
- **Better positioning**: Changed dropdown top position from `calc(100% + var(--space-2))` to `100%` with margin-top for cleaner spacing

### 2. JavaScript Control
- **Added controlled state**: Implemented `showUserDropdown` state with mouse enter/leave handlers
- **Added delay mechanism**: 300ms delay before closing dropdown when mouse leaves
- **Proper cleanup**: Clear timeout on component unmount to prevent memory leaks

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### Navigation.tsx
- Added state management for dropdown visibility
- Implemented mouse enter/leave handlers with timeout
- Added `show` class to dropdown based on state

#### Navigation.css
- Added invisible bridge pseudo-element
- Improved transition timing and visibility handling
- Added support for `.show` class
- Maintained existing hover behavior as fallback

## Benefits
1. **Better UX**: Users can now reliably move their cursor to menu items
2. **Smooth transitions**: Dropdown appears and disappears smoothly
3. **Accessible**: Works with both hover and controlled state
4. **Responsive**: Maintains mobile compatibility

## Technical Details
- Uses `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>` instead of `NodeJS.Timeout` for better TypeScript compatibility
- 300ms delay provides good balance between responsiveness and usability
- CSS transitions ensure smooth visual feedback
- Z-index properly layered to prevent overlapping issues
