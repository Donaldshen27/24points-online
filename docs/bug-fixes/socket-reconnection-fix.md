# Socket.IO Rapid Reconnection Fix

## Issue
The application was experiencing rapid socket connect/disconnect cycles, with clients connecting and disconnecting repeatedly within seconds.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by React StrictMode double-rendering components in development mode, which led to multiple socket connections being created and destroyed rapidly.

## Solution Applied

1. **Removed React StrictMode** (temporary fix)
   - Modified `client/src/main.tsx` to remove StrictMode wrapper
   - This prevents double-rendering in development

2. **Added Singleton Pattern for Socket**
   - Added global `socketInstance` tracking in `socketService.ts`
   - Prevents multiple socket instances from being created

3. **Improved Connection State Management**
   - Added `isConnecting` flag to prevent concurrent connection attempts
   - Better state checking before creating new connections
   - Changed `autoConnect` to false for manual control

4. **Enhanced Server Configuration**
   - Added `pingTimeout: 60000` and `pingInterval: 25000` to server
   - Provides more stable connection parameters

## Future Improvements
1. Re-enable React StrictMode after implementing proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
2. Consider using a more robust state management solution for socket connections
3. Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff

## Testing
After applying these fixes, the rapid reconnection issue should be resolved. You should see:
- Only one "New client connected" message per actual client
- Stable connections without rapid disconnect/reconnect cycles
- Proper cleanup when components unmount
