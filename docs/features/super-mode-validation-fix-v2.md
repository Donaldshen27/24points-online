# Super Mode Validation Fix - Version 2

## Problem
In super mode, where 7 cards are displayed instead of 4, there was a validation bug where even correct answers were marked as failed. The issue was that:

1. The client was sending all 7 center cards in the solution
2. The operations array was empty (0 operations)
3. The server validation expected 6 operations for 7 cards

## Root Cause
The `InteractiveCenterTable` component allowed players to combine cards visually, but when a solution was found:
- It only passed the final expression string and result to the parent component
- The `handleDirectSolution` function tried to find operations for ALL 7 cards using `Calculator.findSolutionOperations(centerCards)`
- This method only worked with exactly 4 cards, so it returned null
- The solution was submitted with all 7 cards but 0 operations

## Solution
Modified the `InteractiveCenterTable` component to:

1. Track which cards were actually used in the solution
2. Track the operations performed
3. Pass both the used cards and operations to the parent component

### Changes Made:

1. **InteractiveCenterTable.tsx**:
   - Added `operationHistory` state to track operations
   - Modified `onSolutionFound` callback to include `usedCards` and `operations` parameters
   - Updated `handleOperationSelect` to create and save Operation objects
   - Modified solution check to collect used cards from the merged card's sourceCards
   - Updated handleReset to also revert operation history

2. **GameScreen.tsx**:
   - Updated `handleDirectSolution` to accept the new parameters
   - Now submits only the used cards and their operations, not all center cards

## How It Works Now

1. Player selects cards and operations in the interactive table
2. Each operation is tracked with the exact values and results
3. When a solution equals 24, the component:
   - Identifies which original cards were used (via sourceCards tracking)
   - Passes the expression, result, used cards, and operations to the parent
4. The solution is submitted with only the cards that were actually used and the correct operations

## Benefits

- Supports super mode's flexibility of using any subset of the 7 cards
- Correctly validates solutions with the appropriate number of operations
- Maintains the visual interaction model while properly tracking the mathematical operations
- Works for solutions using 2, 3, 4, or more cards from the available 7

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Start a super mode game
2. Use any combination of cards to make 24
3. The solution should now be properly validated

Example valid solutions in super mode:
- Using 2 cards: 4 × 6 = 24
- Using 3 cards: (10 - 1) × 3 = 24  
- Using 4 cards: (10 - 4) × (6 - 2) = 24
- Using more cards: ((10 + 3) - 1) × 2 = 24
