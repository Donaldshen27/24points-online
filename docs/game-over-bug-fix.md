# Game Over Bug Fix

## Issue Description
When a player wins by reaching 0 cards, the game gets stuck with:
- Victory screen not showing
- 4 cards remaining in the center (unselectable)
- Incorrect display suggesting winner has 16 cards

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Game End Detection**: The game correctly detects when a player reaches 0 cards and sets state to GAME_OVER on the server
2. **Client State Sync Issue**: The server was emitting 'game-over' event but not 'game-state-updated' with the GAME_OVER state
3. **Pre-round Check**: Added safety check to prevent starting new round when a player has < 2 cards

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Server-side: Enhanced game end detection
- Added pre-round check in `startNewRound()` to end game if either player has < 2 cards
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. Server-side: Fixed client state synchronization
- Modified socket handler to emit 'game-state-updated' before 'game-over' event
- Ensures client's gameState object reflects GAME_OVER state

### 3. Client-side: Simplified game over handling
- Removed redundant state update in handleGameOver
- Relies on game-state-updated event for state synchronization

## How the Game Should End

1. **Normal game flow**:
   - Each player starts with 10 cards
   - Each round, 2 cards from each player (4 total) go to center
   - Winner of round: opponent takes all 4 cards
   - Game ends when one player has 0 cards (winner) or 20 cards (loser)

2. **End game scenario**:
   - Player A has 2 cards, Player B has 18 cards
   - Round starts: both players deal 2 cards to center
   - Player A now has 0 cards in deck, Player B has 16 cards in deck
   - Player A wins the round
   - Player B takes all 4 center cards: 16 + 4 = 20 cards
   - Game ends: Player A wins with 0 cards

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the game server and client
2. Create a game with 2 players
3. Have one player consistently win rounds
4. On the 5th win, the game should properly end with:
   - Victory screen showing for the winner
   - Correct statistics displayed
   - No cards stuck in center
   - Proper deck counts (Winner: 0, Loser: 20)

## Debugging Commands

To see detailed logs during gameplay:
```bash
# Server logs will show:
[GameStateManager] Pre-round check - P1 deck: X, P2 deck: Y
[GameStateManager] Checking win condition - Winner deck: X, Loser deck: Y
[GameStateManager] Game Over - [player] wins (no cards)
```
