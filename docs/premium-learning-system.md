  preferredOperations: {
    addition: number;      // Usage %
    subtraction: number;
    multiplication: number;
    division: number;
  };
  
  // Speed Analysis
  reactionPatterns: {
    instantSolve: number;    // <3s (pattern recognition)
    quickSolve: number;      // 3-10s (calculation)
    methodicalSolve: number; // 10-30s (exploration)
    struggleSolve: number;   // >30s (difficulty)
  };
  
  // Weakness Indicators
  weaknesses: {
    type: 'operation' | 'pattern' | 'speed' | 'accuracy';
    details: string;
    severity: 1-10;

  selectNextPuzzle(profile: PlayerProfile): Puzzle {
    // 70% targeted at weaknesses
    // 20% at current skill level
    // 10% stretch challenges
  }
  
  // Real-time adjustment based on:
  adjustDifficulty(performance: SolveAttempt): void {
    // - Solve time
