# Solution Replay Implementation

## Overview
The solution replay system has been implemented to show step-by-step animations of how a player solved the 24-point puzzle. This helps opponents understand the solution and learn new strategies.

## Components Created

### 1. SolutionReplay Component
Main component that orchestrates the entire replay animation.

**Features:**
- Step-by-step animation of operations
- Card highlighting when used
- Operation display with color-coded operators
- Results history bubbles
- Final celebration animation
- Play/pause and skip controls

**Props:**
- `solution`: The Solution object containing cards and operations
- `onComplete`: Callback when replay finishes
- `autoPlay`: Whether to start playing automatically (default: true)
- `speed`: Playback speed multiplier (0.5-2, default: 1)

### 2. Integration with Game Flow

**Modified Components:**
- **GameScreen**: Added solution replay state and triggers
- **RoundResult**: Added hideForReplay prop to prevent overlap

**Flow:**
1. Player submits correct solution
2. Round result is shown briefly
3. Solution replay starts automatically
4. Cards transfer animation plays after replay
5. Next round begins

### 3. Visual Design

**Card States:**
- Normal: Default white cards
- Highlighted: Golden glow when being used
- Used: Faded and scaled down after calculation

**Operators:**
- Addition (+): Green circle
- Subtraction (−): Blue circle
- Multiplication (×): Orange circle
- Division (÷): Red circle

**Animations:**
- Cards pulse when highlighted
- Operators appear with rotation effect
- Results pop in with scale effect
- Final "= 24!" with spring animation

## Technical Details

### Animation Library
Using Framer Motion for smooth, interruptible animations with:
- `motion` components for animated elements
- `AnimatePresence` for exit animations
- Spring physics for natural movement

### Timing System
```typescript
const steps: AnimationStep[] = [
  { type: 'setup', duration: 500 },
  { type: 'operation', operationIndex: 0, duration: 2000 },
  { type: 'operation', operationIndex: 1, duration: 2000 },
  { type: 'operation', operationIndex: 2, duration: 2000 },
  { type: 'complete', duration: 1000 }
];
```

Total duration: ~7.5 seconds at normal speed

### State Management
- `currentStep`: Tracks animation progress
- `highlightedCards`: Set of card indices being used
- `usedCards`: Set of cards already calculated
- `currentOperation`: Index of operation being shown
- `showResult`: Controls when to show operation results

## Usage Example

```typescript
// In GameScreen, when round ends with correct solution:
{showingSolutionReplay && replaySolution && (
  <SolutionReplay
    solution={replaySolution}
    onComplete={() => {
      setShowingSolutionReplay(false);
      setReplaySolution(null);
    }}
    autoPlay={true}
    speed={1}
  />
)}
```

## Accessibility Features

1. **Reduced Motion Support**: Animations are simplified for users who prefer reduced motion
2. **Skip Controls**: Users can skip the replay at any time
3. **High Contrast**: Clear visual distinction between elements
4. **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback for operations and success
2. **Multiple Solutions**: Show alternative ways to solve
3. **Speed Preferences**: Remember user's preferred playback speed
4. **Tutorial Mode**: Extended explanations for learning
5. **Replay History**: Allow reviewing past solutions

## Benefits

1. **Educational**: Players learn new solving strategies
2. **Transparency**: Shows that solutions are legitimate
3. **Engagement**: Keeps both players interested during downtime
4. **Visual Appeal**: Adds polish to the game experience
5. **Fairness**: Everyone sees the same solution clearly
