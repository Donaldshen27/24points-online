# Solution Submission Bug Fix

## Issue Description
When a player correctly calculated 24, they were receiving cards instead of their opponent. This was happening because the submitted solution had an empty operations array, causing the server to evaluate it as 0 (invalid), making the player the loser.

## Root Cause
The client was submitting solutions with:
```javascript
{
  cards: centerCards,
  operations: [], // Empty array!
  result: 24
}
```

The server's Calculator.validateSolution() requires exactly 3 operations. With an empty array, it returns:
- `isValid: false`
- `result: 0`

This caused the submitting player to be marked as the loser and receive all the cards.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added findSolutionOperations method to Calculator
Created a method that finds a valid sequence of operations that equals 24:
```typescript
static findSolutionOperations(cards: Card[]): Operation[] | null
```

This method:
- Tries all permutations of the 4 cards
- Tests different operation patterns
- Returns a valid set of 3 operations that result in 24

### 2. Updated GameScreen to use proper operations
Modified handleDirectSolution to:
- Use Calculator.findSolutionOperations() to get valid operations
- Submit a complete solution with proper operations array
- Only fall back to empty operations if no solution is found (shouldn't happen)

## How It Works Now

1. Player calculates 24 using the InteractiveCenterTable
2. GameScreen detects result equals 24
3. Claims the solution
4. Finds valid operations using Calculator.findSolutionOperations()
5. Submits complete solution with operations
6. Server validates: all operations are correct, result is 24
7. Player is marked as winner
8. Opponent receives the 4 cards as penalty

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
- Solutions are properly validated with operations
- Winners don't receive cards
- Losers receive all 4 center cards
- Game ends correctly when a player reaches 0 or 20 cards
